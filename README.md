# DFF_KAT

The DFF KAPPA Analysis Tool is intended to aid in the analysis of assessing any shifts in tokens.

This is implemented in two stages.
1. It generates a single master excel file with the DFF_KAPPA analysis results and DFF Token values for Old and New TP split out by module.

2. It exports data per sub module to JMP for MO's to perform further data analysis on any DFF Tokens which are failing for R-Squared, Offset or % Match
